            "responses": ["The history of Centre dates back to 1974 when the Department of Electronics (DoE) now Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), Govt. of India and the University Grants Commission (UGC) set up the first CEDT within the premises of Indian Institute of Science (IISc.), Bangalore with assistance from Swiss Development Corporation.\n\nA decade after the successful running of CEDT, Bangalore, DoE (now MeitY) set up similar centres at Aurangabad, Imphal and Srinagar in 1987, Calicut, Mohali and Gorakhpur in 1989, with an objective to develop human resources at different levels and in different specialized areas of Electronics Design. Aim was to bridge the gap between the academic institutions and industries.\n\nThe CEDT centres based at Aurangabad, Calicut, Gorakhpur, Imphal and Srinagar were merged with DOEACC (a scientific society of MeitY) in 2001. In order for its metamorphism into an Institute of National Importance the Society was renamed as \u2018National Institute of Electronics and Information Technology (NIELIT) on October 10, 2011.\nNIELIT Aurangabad Centre was established in the year 1987 as a solution-oriented model organization for promotion of Electronics, IT and knowledge-based enterprise through development of appropriate human resources and intellectual properties. It is co-located inside the lush green campus of Dr B.A.M. University and its campus is spreads over more than 18 acres. It has about 14 well equipped laboratories and Mechanical workshop besides a rich Library, Gymnasium for students, Auditorium, Canteen, Basket-ball ground, Volley ball ground, Kho Kho ground etc.\n\nThe prime role of the Centre is to train manpower in Electronics Design & Technology, Information Technology, Electronics Product Design & Development, Manufacturing (Electronics & Mechanical) Technology, Applied research and Consultancy in the field of Information, Electronics and Communication Technology (IECT).\n\nThe Industrial grade laboratories of the Centre are fully equipped with the latest systems and development tools in the areas such as CAD/CAM, Consumer Electronics, Embedded System Design, Industrial Automation, Internet of Things, Network and Server Facilities, Open Source Computing, Opto-Electronics, Printed Circuit Board, Power Electronics Lab, Testing & Measurement and VLSI Design.\n\nBesides numerous reference books, Journals, magazines; the students of the Centre have access to MeitY Library Consortium (rich collection of latest e-Journals including IEEE and books) and National Knowledge Network (NKN) a strong a network with multi-gigabit capability connected to all universities, research institutions, libraries, laboratories, healthcare and agricultural institutions across the country.\n\nAll the labs, library and office are connected through the central network and students can retrieve information from their terminals itself and through well connected Wi-Fi system. The Centre organizes National Level Seminars/Workshops in areas like Agri-Electronics, Electronics Product Design, Intellectual Property Rights(IPR), Neural Networks, e-learning regularly.\n\nThe Centre offers varied range of courses in Formal and non-Formal Sector in the areas of IECT. The most sought after Formal Sector Courses that the Centre offers includes Diploma in Electronics Production and Maintenance since 1987, M.Tech (Electronics Design and Technology) since 1990, B Tech (Electronics System Engineering) since 2013 and is also a Recognized Research Centre of the Dr. B.A.M. University, Aurangabad since 2007 for conducting research leading to award of Ph.D. Degree in Engineering and Technology.    \nIn non-formal Sector, the Centre is offering a Bouquet of around 25 NSQF aligned Diploma and Certificate Courses in emerging areas of Electronics and IT including Mobile Application Development using Android, Web Designing, Web Application Development in Dot Net, CAD using CREO, on Printed Circuit Board (Design, Analysis and Manufacturing Techniques), Additive Manufacturing /3D Printing, Advance Diploma in Computer Application Accounting and Publishing, Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP, Arduino/Raspberry Pi based Embedded System Design, Cyber Security to name a few.\nUnder PPP model the Centre is offering O/A/B/C level in IT, O/A level in Hardware and Digital Literacy Courses (BCC/CCC/CCC+/ECC). Some of these courses are recognized by many State Governments including Maharashtra for employment purpose (http://nielit.gov.in/content/recognition-0).\nThe Centre also provides consultancy and other services to leading Industries of the region like Bajaj Auto Ltd, Videocon, Sterlite, Siemens, Meltron, Maharashtra Police Wireless, etc. The Centre is also organizing National Level Seminars/Workshops in Agri-Electronics, Electronics Product Design, Intellectual Property Rights(IPR), Neural Networks, e-learning, etc from time to time.\nThe Centre is also implementing number of Projects for the Empowerment of Weaker Section of Society especially for candidates belonging to SC/ST, Rural, Minorities, Women and other underprivileged strata of society through skill development in IT Skills, Electronics Equipment Repair & Maintenance and ITES-BPO (Customer Care & Banking) sector leading to their enhanced livelihood. It is also implementing a project sponsored by Director General (Resettlement), Ministry of Defence, Government of India for skill development of Army Jawan on CHM O-Level course.\nIt is also implementing ESDM scheme sponsored by Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) for developing human resource with adequate competence levels in Electronics Design & Production Technologies, e-Waste management. Other scheme being implemented by Centre includes e-Waste Management, ISEA and Digital Marketing for Traders.\n Trained to become R&D engineers students of the centre are working in leading and reputed organizations like C.G Coral. Lucent India, Texas, L&T, HCL, Wipro Technologies, BITS, IIT, BEL, HAL, ISRO,DRDO, BARC, ECIL, Messung, Thermax, Honeywell Cyrus logic L&T EMSYS to name a few.\nThe core values of excellence, integrity, transparency, quality, team work, execution with passion, trust, continuous and student centric learning has enabled bridging of the gap between academics & industry requirements and helped to foster the achievement of the Centre thus established NIELIT Centre Aurangabad a leader in so many areas.\nOur aim is to achieve global leadership in human resource development and excellence in technical, education and research."]

In the brave new world a widespread access to information, communications and resources is the only solution to remove the insurmountable barriers to education, democratization process and overall economic growth. The primary objectives of the Research and Development programmes supported by NIELIT is thus to facilitate proliferation and absorption of emerging technologies in the IT sector, facilitate capacity building, creating the right infrastructure and making the existing technologies, affordable to the citizens of the country. This is the only way to take lead in the global knowledge economy. NIELIT supports Research and Development and coordinates the technical activities of the respective Scientific Societies.\n\nElectronics\nThe Electronics sector is a key player in the economy and one of the most globalised industries in the world. It is a strategic enabler and a driving force for all the services, be it Internet, telecom, precision engineering industries, aviation, energy, banking imagine any service, nothing works without Electronics. The rapidly growing Indian electronics industry can be broadly categorised into six segments. They are consumer Electronics (the largest chunk of the market), industrial Electronics, strategic Electronics, Computers, Communication and Broadcasting equipment and Electronic components. \n\nA key focus in the Electronics sector is R&D leading to innovative products. NIELIT has long acknowledged R&D as an integral part of Electronics ecosystem and is supporting the entire value chain of R&D activities in the country ranging from the basic components to sophisticated product development.\n\nAs a roadmap for developing, strengthening and enhancing the competitiveness of the Indian Electronics sector NIELIT has constituted a group-R&D in Electronics Group to conduct sponsored R&D activities across India at various academic institutions of higher learning and R&D laboratories, in the areas assigned to it through a variety of plan programmes. The sophisticated projects assigned to the groups cover a wide spectrum of key technological areas. These include developments in Nanotechnology, Medical Electronics, Microelectronics, Industrial Electronics et al. For more info please visit https://beta.nielit.gov.in/kolkata/guwahati/node/10962"]
